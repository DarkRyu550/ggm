### General Game Music ###
##########################

A library for reading and synthesizing (or just simply weaving) music ripped
straight out of games, in their native format, and producing form them raw PCM
audio that would be the closest equivalent to the original target audio format.

# Feature Matrix #
##################

Currently, this library supprts the following formats:

|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Format  | From                           | Support Proggress | Cargo Feature |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Organya | Cave Story (洞窟物語)          | 100% - Public     | organya       |
| AST     | Some Nintendo GCN or Wii games |  85% - Public     | ast           |
| GSF     | GameBoy Advance ROM rips       | ~25% - Planned    | N/A           |
| USF     | Nintendo 64 ROM rips           |   0% - Planned    | N/A           |
| PSF     | PlayStation ROM rips           |   0% - Planned    | N/A           |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|

Some development notes for the formats:

| Format  | Notes                                                              |

| GSF     | The implementation of an ARMv4 interpreter for the ROM code is     |
|         | under way, currently supporting data processing and on its way to  |
|         | support the multiplication extensions.                             |
| AST     | Apparently, the format differs substantially between the games it  |
|         | gets used in. For now, the AST support is limited to mostly just   |
|         | Super Mario Galaxy.                                                |

# Licensing #
#############

The source code files in this project are under the BSD 3-clause license.
However, as might be predictable for a library whose goal is to play ripped
audio, there are some slight caveats and notable exceptions. Listed below:

|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Format  | Caveat                                                             |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organya | Due to the format's reliance on pre-specified instrument           |
|         | definitions, for the synths to sound true to how they would sound  |
|         | in-game, we need to use both the instrument waveform bank and the  |
|         | percussion descriptors from the original game or the NX Engine,    |
|         | which are freeware and GPLv3, respectively.                        |
|         |                                                                    |
|         | For that reason, bundling files from these sources into the binary |
|         | might result in some wacky licensing effects. So, you may wish to  |
|         | disable the bundling of those assets by enabling the `no-organya-  |
|         | builtin-wavetable` and `no-organya-builtin-pixtone` build flags.   |
|         |                                                                    |
|         | NOTE: For now these files are distributed along with the build     |
|         | scripts in this repository! That is a terrible decision that will  |
|         | be fixed once I figure out how to properly and reliably extract    |
|         | these assets from the original game executable. If you have any    |
|         | complaints about that please contact me.                           |
